# counts the number of times a given int occurs in a Linked List
## Method 1 - Without Recursion
```
1. Initialize count as zero
2. Loop through each element of linked list:
  a) If element data is equal to the passed number then increment the count.
3. Return count
```
## Method 2 - With Recursion
### Algorithm
```
count(head, key);
if head is NULL
return frequency
if (head->data == key)
increase frequency by 1
count(head->next, key)
```
